* Python

-PROJECT OVERVIEW-
* I built a console game where a player can make a guess and be told if their guess is too high or too low. 
* The game ends when the player guesses the correct number. 
* Players are encouraged to do this in the lowest number of tries possible by trying to beat their high-score.
